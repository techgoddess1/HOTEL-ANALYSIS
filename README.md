Using Deep  Learning to analysis and predict people likely to cancel there bookings based on specific attributes and coming up with the best model. 
A sequential model was used which was dense with multiple hidden layers and using Dropout to prevent overfitting.
The model had a 99 percent training accuracy and a validation accuracy of 100 percent.
